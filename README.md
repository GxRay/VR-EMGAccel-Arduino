## Purpose
The patient will have a wearable EMG belt placed on their bodies to obtain the EMG/Positional data of the targeted muscles mentioned above. The Belt will consist of 2 pouches each housing a certain number of circuits and batteries that will be placed in circuit covers that will be mentioned later. Referring to Figure below the first pouch will contain 2 batteries to power the circuits (B in the figure) and 3 circuits (Numbers 1-3).  This pouch will also house the microcontroller that will send the data wirelessly to a device (M in the figure). The second pouch will house 2 more batteries and the remaining 2 circuits totalling to 5 circuits all together. Each circuit will have electrodes attached to wires protruding from the pouches to be attached to the patient
